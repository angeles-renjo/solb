              Balance and Restoration: The primary objective of this project is
              to help young creatives find the equilibrium between their
              relentless pursuit of creativity and the essential need for
              restorative downtime. Mindfulness and Emotional Well-being:
              MindGlow integrates principles from the Stutz mental health tools
              to offer a gamified, interactive experience. Through this, it aims
              to assist individuals in identifying their emotions and uplifting
              their mood.
